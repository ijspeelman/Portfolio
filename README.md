# Isaac Speelman's Data Portfolio
Howdy!

Thanks for clicking on my portfolio. If you are here, you've either curiously typed in my github link from my resume or somehow stumbled upon this page. Either way, it is nice to have you.

Since you probably already know a bit about me, I will keep it brief before allowing my projects to do some talking. I graduated in 2023 with a BS in Mathematics from the University of Cincinnati. While studying for my degree, I had a full time job at Integrity Express Logistics where I've learned all about the wonderful world of transportation. Throughout the years, I've changed departments picking up new skills as I progressed towards my degree and eventual position of Associate Date Engineer. Prior to this position, I had shown my superiors my interest with analytics with Excel and SQL data exploration projects involving truck company fraud and truck insurance claims.

With my new position, I have gained new experience with Power BI and R. I am consistently tasked with fielding ad hoc reports from users and creating SQL queries, Power BI dashboards, and using R to automate reports. Sometimes all three in the same project! Currently, I am working on a Machine Learning project in R using XGBoost to determine customer churn.
